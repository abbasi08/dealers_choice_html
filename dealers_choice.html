    <h1>Polyamory</h1>
    <h2>What is polyamory?</h2>
    <p>Polyamory is the practice of, or desire for, intimate relationships with more than one partner, with the informed consent of all partners involved.[1][2] People who identify as polyamorous may believe in open relationships with a conscious management of jealousy and reject the view that sexual and relational exclusivity are necessary for deep, committed, long-term, loving relationships.[3][4] Others prefer to restrict their sexual activity to only members of the group, a closed polyamorous relationship which is usually referred to as polyfidelity.</p>

    <h3>Is "polyamory" the same as ENM?</h3>
    <p>ENM, or Ethical Non-Monogamy is is the practice of non-monogamous sexual relations that is distinguished from infidelity by the knowledge and consent of those involved, and from polygamy by the various partners not being in a single marriage. Forms of consensual non-monogamy include swinging, polyamory, open relationships and cuckolding fetishism.
        Polyamory is just one form of ENM.
